# George’s Android Utilities

A collection of various android-related utilities I have created. 

* Min heap implementation (for objects tagged with numeric priorities)
* A version `String.format` that works with Spanned strings and preserved rich text formatting
* A version of FragmentTabListener that allows the fragment manager to save and
  restore instance state across activity recreations.
